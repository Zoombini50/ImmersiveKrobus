		//From here you will need to Edit Event files, which I cannot be too specific about as you need creative freedom.. however I will try to explain the important Mechanics
		//You will need to use EditData targeted to one of the event areas in Data/Events, for example, Data/Events/SeedShop
		//Remember the following data: EventID/Conditions
		//EventID is a unique number generated by you. (14003450 for example) make sure it's a high number so it is highly unlikely another modder uses it.
		//Conditions are covered at the wiki: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data I cannot go to greatly in detail here but if you have questions, come find me on Discord.
		//The first few event commands are a requirement: musicID/viewport/NPC and farmer placement
		//The Music ID is a coded name for what music plays. Use Cane's Resource for a list of Music IDs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CpDrw23peQiq-C7F2FjYOMePaYe0Rc9BwQsj3h6sjyo/edit#gid=239695361
		//Veiwport is where the camera is.. you can use a debug mod to get these coordinates.  It only needs an X and Y (/54 20/)
		//NPCs and farmer placement is next and must be done, lest you softlock.  The farmer MUST be placed even if you are not using him.  If you don't need the farmer, put the farmer on the coordinates -1000 1000 0.  You need x, y, and facingDirection.
		//After this your event will begin.  You can do various things to make great effects.  Please refer to the wiki for commands as there is too many to talk about.
		//Here is a sample

		},*/
		//9588563 is the Event ID.  This Event has the following conditions: f Krobus 500 mean you need to have at least two hearts with your NPC.  t 700 1000 means that this event only triggers between 7AM to 10AM ingame.  This translates that the event won't trigger until you have 2 hearts with your NPC and go to town between 7-10 AM.
		//The Music ID is springtown.  And the viewport is near the saloon (34 82).  The farmer will be out of frame but standing in town while your NPC has Haley and Alex nearby.  Penny is at a nearby tree.  
		//From here you will have to shape the event on your own using wiki and you can always come talk to me.
