*															Dialogue Template: Day to Day speech																		*
*																																										*
*			This file determines what your NPC says during the days.  You can use different tokens to symbolize your character's personality. 							*
*																																										*
*   Basic Keys: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun : These are the days of the week and must have a capitol letter to be parsed correctly.								*
*	Heart-Level is determined with a number at the end. (example: Mon4 is for Monday with 4 hearts.) You can only use even numbers.										*
*	Seasonal Dialogue is determined with the season name (lowercase) and the day of the week after an underscore. (summer_Wed)											*
*	You can combine some tokens to make more dialogue: winter_Tue6 for example, means on a Tuesday during winter when you have 6 hearts.								*
*	You may also specify an exact day using Season followed by the day (1-28): fall_14 means the 14th day of fall.  This is useful for specific events.					*
*	Response Dialogue goes here from Events and Questions made for the NPC.  They are determined by you and some examples are provided below.							*
*	Introduction is a one time use dialogue used to Introduce your NPC to the player.																					*
*	danceRejection, dumped_Girls (dumped_Guys), secondChance_Girls (secondChance_Guys), and divorced are not all needed but you should put them in if your NPC can		*
*		get married.																																					*
*																																										*
*	There are plenty of options to dialogue use.  If you wish to use the full range of dialogue, see: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Dialogue					*
