				/*breakdown of the code, for our learning:
				First is the ID, I chose the day, woohoo!
				continue is the initial "music". (15, 16) are the coordinates the camera is focused on.
				Next are the coordinates of the farmer and Krobus, (X, Y, direction they're facing).
				I then set the music to play, Icicles, because it wouldn't work in the first slot, where continue is. Jonqora and I don't know why. 
				Then we have Krobus with the "?" emote before turning around to discover the farmer! They both jump; 8 is the default value for jump. Not sure what happens if we make it greater or smaller, but that can be tested!
				Then the dialog happens, which include the portraits.
				Then there's the farmer emote of the cute smiley face.
				Screen fades to black.
				Krobus mentions his last bit of dialog, and the event ends.
				Then there's the placeholder for the dialog that Krobus will say next time you talk to him.

				Additional enhancements I thought of:
				1) Currently this event plays the next time you go into the sewers, so we may want to look into adding a When condition so this only plays the first time you go into the sewer. I'd have to look into it.
				2) I think it'd be nice if the farmer and Krobus walk back together towards where his shop is. His movement will be simple since he's only moving along the X axis, but the farmer's movement would be tougher, unless we're able to just have them move along the Y axis and the scene fades to black before they have to turn the corner!
