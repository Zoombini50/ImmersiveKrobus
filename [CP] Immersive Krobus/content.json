				/*breakdown of the code, for our learning:
				First is the ID, I chose the day, woohoo!
				continue is the initial "music". (-1000 -1000) are the initial coordinates the camera is focused on. This is so the screen is black at first.
				Next are the coordinates of the player and Krobus, (X, Y, direction they're facing).
				Then the viewport, the coordinates the camera is focused on, is changed to (22, 18).
				Then set the music to play, Icicles, because it wouldn't work in the first slot, where continue is.
				There's a pause to give the scene a moment to "breathe". Then we have the player looking around the sewer with the different faceDirection commands.
				Then we have Krobus with the "?" emote before walking to discover the player! They both jump; 8 is the default value for jump, and it's a big one! There's a skippable command in there right before Krobus moves, in case there's a mod that changes the layout of the sewer and Krobus gets stuck.
				Then the dialog happens, which include the portraits.
				Then there's the farmer emote of the cute smiley face.
				Screen fades to black.
				Krobus mentions his last bit of dialog, and the event ends.
				Then there's the placeholder for the dialog that Krobus will say next time you talk to him.

				The When condition checks that the player hasn't talked to Krobus yet (haven't met). That way, the event only plays the first time you go into the sewers, and he doesn't introduce himself if you've already met.

				The dialog is formatted for i18n, so that it's easier to translate.

	// Could we add a non-required dependency for the canon-compliant dialogue expansion? It's quite popular—I use it—and I don't want it to override our Krobus. :) -G
