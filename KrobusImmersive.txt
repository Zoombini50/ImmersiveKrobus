-Events-

Introductory
* Triggered when player first enters the sewers
* Waived in favor of intro by Marlon in SVE

(Krobus is walking around in the sewer or standing in his shop. Player enters the area. Both jump.)
Krobus: "Oh! A human..."
(Both shake a little.)
Krobus: "P-Please, don't be alarmed. I am different than the others."
Player: ("?")
Krobus: "Yes, I can speak your language. I've spent a lot of time observing humans... from the shadows."
Krobus: "..." -> (emote instead?)
Krobus: "Perhaps..."
Krobus: "I know humans like to shop. Care to see my wares?"
Player: (":)")
(fade to black)
Krobus:"I gather items I find here in the sewers to sell. I also have trinkets and treasures made by my people. I hope you find something that pleases you."

After event:
"I am open for business."

Two-Heart
* Enter the sewer at night (between 8 and 12 maybe).
(Krobus is moving about his shop area--perhaps some added scenery?--poking at objects. Player enters.)
Krobus: Ah! Hello, [Player]! I was just rearranging my shop.
(Krobus walks to his position when the shop is open.)
Krobus: "Please feel free to examine my wares. However, you should not stay long. Some others of my kind may visit during the witching hour."
Krobus: "Most shadow people are suspicious of humans. There have been too many... unpleasant encounters."
(fork)
Krobus: "[Player], have you met others like me, in the mines?"
  - Yes, but they attacked me
      Krobus: "I am sorry. As I said, we've learned to fear humans. I hope... no... never mind."
  - No, not yet
    Krobus: "Please be careful. They may be hostile toward you. As I said, we've learned to fear humans..."
(End fork)
(Sad Krobus emote bubble.)
Krobus: "It is considered dishonorable among my people to flee from an enemy. I hope that... one day... there will be peace."
